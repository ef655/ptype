	If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a
	hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory
	gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor
	yourself, you will succumb in every battle.

	Imagine a society that subjects people to conditions that make them terribly unhappy,
	then gives them the drugs to take away their unhappiness. Science fiction? It is already
	happening to some extent in our own society... Instead of removing the conditions that
	make people depressed, modern society gives them antidepressant drugs. In effect,
	antidepressants are a means of modifying an individual's internal state in such a way as
	to enable him to tolerate social conditions that he would otherwise find intolerable.

	It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom,
	it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of
	incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was
	the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us,
	we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going
	direct the other way

	"What's wrong with old Maggot?" asked Pippin. "He's a good friend to all

	ferocious dogs -- but after all, folk down here are near the border and
	have to be more on their guard."
